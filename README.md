#### Enhanced Chat
> A Chat Interceptor API for splicing and editting outgoing server chat messages based on specifc keywords.

#### Why would plugins use this
	Plugins would be able to add their own functionality to chat.
	Plugins would not be required to implement their own packet interceptor.
	Plugins would not need to handle TextComponents on their own.
