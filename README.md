# Chat Interception (Adding hover-tips, commands, insertions, and urls to text in chat): 

This 'overrides' / 'rewrites' chat. Whenever someone sends a message in chat, wether that is from a user or a plugin,
(It doesn't matter either way... based on how I did this), we check the message if it contains a keyword like a Town's
name, and if it has a Town's name, we might want to insert some hover-tip, commands, insertion, and or even a url onto only that Town name.
